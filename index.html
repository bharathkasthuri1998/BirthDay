      <h1 align="center">GREAT WOMEN'S</h1>
     <h2>Women's are Real Architect of Society</h2>
     <p>Almost every woman has two personalities. She can be helpless, quivering, and vulnerable on one hand and be strong and dependable on the other. She is soft to touch and you want to comfort her and keep her from harm, but in a crisis she is the one who will support you and give you strength.</p>

     <p>International Women's Day (IWD) is celebrated on 8 March around the world.[3] It is a focal point in the movement for women's rights.After the Socialist Party of America organized a Women's Day in New York City on February 28, 1909, German delegates Clara Zetkin, Käte Duncker, Paula Thiede and others proposed at the 1910 International Socialist Woman's Conference that "a special Women's Day" be organized annually.[4] After women gained suffrage in Soviet Russia in 1917, March 8 became a national holiday there.[5] The day was then predominantly celebrated by the socialist movement and communist countries until it was adopted by the feminist movement in about 1967. The United Nations began celebrating the day in 1977.[6]Commemoration international Women's Day today ranges from being a public holiday in some countries to being largely ignored elsewhere.[7] In some places, it is a day of protest; in others, it is a day that celebrates womanhood.[8]</p>

     <p>Teresa was first recognised by the Indian government more than a third of a century earlier, receiving the Padma Shri in 1962 and the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in 1969.[79] She later received other Indian awards, including the Bharat Ratna (India's highest civilian award) in 1980.[80] Teresa's official biography, by Navin Chawla, was published in 1992.[81] In Kolkata, she is worshipped as a deity by some Hindus.To commemorate the 100th anniversary of her birth, the government of India issued a special ₹5 coin (the amount of money Teresa had when she arrived in India) on 28 August 2010. President Pratibha Patil said, "Clad in a white sari with a blue border, she and the sisters of Missionaries of Charity became a symbol of hope to many – the aged, the destitute, the unemployed, the diseased, the terminally ill, and those abandoned by their families.Indian views of Teresa are not uniformly favorable. Aroup Chatterjee, a physician born and raised in Calcutta who was an activist in the city's slums for years around 1980 before moving to the UK, said that he "never even saw any nuns in those slums".[84] His research, involving more than 100 interviews with volunteers, nuns and others familiar with the Missionaries of Charity, was described in a 2003 book critical of Teresa.[84] Chatterjee criticized her for promoting a "cult of suffering" and a distorted, negative image of Calcutta, exaggerating work done by her mission and misusing funds and privileges at her disposal.[84][85] According to him, some of the hygiene problems he had criticized (needle reuse, for example) improved after Teresa's death in 1997.</p>

     	<p>She was the president who have enjoyed every bit of her presidential rights, she hails from a place called JALGAON which is in maharshtra, i still remember she was suppose to come to jalgaon, the airport was not functional at that point of time, authorities made it functional in 15 days only. It just went to zero after her plane landed. But this is 1 achievement she has to mk authorities work efficiently. No doubt it's for their own good.She took 36 trucks out when she left presidential house after completing her term as president.She actually acquited 132 prisoners when she got the petition of their faith. Most of them were serious criminalsPatil had been loyal to the INC and the Nehru-Gandhi family for decades and this was considered to be a significant factor in her selection by INC leader Sonia Gandhi, although Patil said that she had no intention of being a "rubber-stamp president".She actually built a mansion on army allocated plot with public funds.These are the few achievements she has. Though she held lots of key positions in the government from 1975 to 2000 but work is very few…</p>

     	<p>As prime minister, Gandhi was known for her political intransigency and unprecedented centralisation of power. She went to war with Pakistan in support of the independence movement and war of independence in East Pakistan, which resulted in an Indian victory and the creation of Bangladesh, as well as increasing India's influence to the point where it became the sole regional power of South Asia. Citing separatist tendencies, and in response to a call for revolution, Gandhi instituted a state of emergency from 1975 to 1977 where basic civil liberties were suspended and the press was censored. Widespread atrocities were carried out during the emergency.[6] In 1980, she returned to power after free and fair elections. After Gandhi ordered military action in the Golden Temple in Operation Blue Star, her own bodyguards and Sikh nationalists assassinated her on 31 October 1984.</p>
